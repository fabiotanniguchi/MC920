Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_APPRDX_SIMPLE to compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If

we wanted all the poinls along the contour, without com-
pression, we can pass in cv2.CHAIN_APPRUX_NONE; however/
be very sparing when using this funcÔ¨Åon. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful
of resources
