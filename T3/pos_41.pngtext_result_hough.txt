Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_APFP SIMPLE to compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points onl This saves both computation and memory. If

we wants all the points along the contour, without com-
pression, we can pass in CV? . CHAINJFPRUXJIONE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often Lumecessary and is wasteful
of resources.
