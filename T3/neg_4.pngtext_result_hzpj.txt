Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_AFFBOX.SIMPLE to compress
horizomal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end~
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If

we wanted all the points along the contour, without com~
pression, we can pass in cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NDNE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful
of resources.
