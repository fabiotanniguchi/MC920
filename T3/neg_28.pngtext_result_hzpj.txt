Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_APPROX.SIMPLE lo compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end»
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If

we wanted all the points along the contour, without com-
pression, we can pass in cvlCHAIlLAPPRDLNDNE; however,
be vely sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful
of resources.
