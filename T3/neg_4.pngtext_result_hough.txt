Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use chCi-IAINJFFRDLSIMPLE to compress
horizuntai, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only. This saves both computation and memory. if

we wanted all the points along the contour, without comA
pression, we can pass in cv2.CHAIN_APPRDX_NDNE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful
of resources.
