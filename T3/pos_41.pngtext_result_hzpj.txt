Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_APPRD SIMPLE to compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only This saves both computation and memory. if

we wanted all the points along the contour, without com~
pression/ we can pass in CV? . CHAINJFPRULNUNE; however,
be Very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often Lumecessary and is wasteful
of resources
