Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use :v2.CHAIN_APPROX.SIMPLE {o compress
horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments into their endÂ»
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If

we wanted all the points along the contour, without comv
pression, we can pass in cvlCHAIlLAPPRDLNDNE; however,
be vely sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wastefu}
of resources.
