Our last argument is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CHAIN_APFRUX,SIMPLE to compress
horizontal, Vertical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only. This saves both computation and memory. If
we wanted all the points along the contour, without comâ€”
pression, we can pass in cv2.CHAIN_APPRDX,NUNE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful

of resources.
